Cosmic Clash

Game Description

Cosmic Clash is a simple 2D space shooter game where players control a spaceship to dodge and destroy falling asteroids. The game provides an engaging introduction to game development using Python and Pygame.

Instructions

Ensure that you have Python installed on your system (preferably Python 3.x).

Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

Update the image directory paths in the code to match your local setup.

Run the game script to start playing.

Installation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Cosmic-Clash.git
cd Cosmic-Clash

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3Ô∏è‚É£ Update Image Paths

Modify the directory paths for images in the game script to match your local system‚Äôs file structure.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Game

To start the game, execute:

python main.py

Objective

The player controls a spaceship that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen. The goal is to avoid colliding with asteroids that randomly fall from the top while shooting them down for points.

Gameplay

Move the spaceship left and right using arrow keys.

Shoot bullets by pressing spacebar.

Asteroids randomly spawn at the top and move downward.

If an asteroid collides with the spaceship, the game ends with a Game Over message.

Destroy asteroids by shooting them for points.

Scoring

Each destroyed asteroid gives 10 points.

Graphics

The game includes background, spaceship, asteroid, and bullet images for visual effects.

The score is displayed in the top-left corner.

Key Features

‚úÖ Spaceship Movement: Move left and right.
‚úÖ Bullet Shooting: Fire bullets using the spacebar.
‚úÖ Random Asteroid Spawning: Asteroids spawn at random intervals.
‚úÖ Collision Detection:

Checks for collisions between spaceship and asteroids.

Checks for collisions between bullets and asteroids.

Controls

üéÆ Left/Right Arrow Keys ‚Äì Move the spaceship
üéÆ Spacebar ‚Äì Fire bullets

End Condition

The game ends when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.

This project is a fun and simple introduction to game development with Pygame, incorporating mechanics like movement, collision detection, and object interaction.
