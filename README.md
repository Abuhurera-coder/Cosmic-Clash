Game Description:
Objective: The player controls a spaceship that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen. The goal is to avoid colliding with asteroids that randomly fall from the top while shooting them down for points.
Gameplay:
The spaceship moves left or right using the arrow keys.
The player can shoot bullets by pressing the spacebar.
Asteroids appear randomly at the top and fall downward.
If an asteroid collides with the spaceship, the game ends with a "Game Over" message.
If a bullet collides with an asteroid, both are removed, and the player earns points.
Scoring: Points are gained by shooting asteroids. Each asteroid destroyed gives the player 10 points.
Graphics: Background, spaceship, asteroid, and bullet images are used for visual effects, and the score is displayed at the top-left corner.
Key Features:
Spaceship movement: Can move left and right.
Bullet shooting: Bullets can be fired with spacebar.
Random asteroids: Asteroids spawn at random intervals and move downward.
Collision detection: The game checks for collisions between the spaceship and asteroids as well as between bullets and asteroids.
Controls:
Arrow keys (Left/Right): Move the spaceship.
Spacebar: Fire bullets.
End Condition: The game ends when the spaceship collides with an asteroid.
This project provides a simple but fun introduction to game development with pygame, with mechanics like movement, collision detection, and object interaction.
